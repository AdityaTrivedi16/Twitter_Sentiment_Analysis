Conducted Sentiment Analysis on a Twitter dataset using NLP techniques like CountVectorizer, TFIDF, Bigrams, and Trigrams, within a specific project or time frame, to extract meaningful insights from text data.
Enhanced data quality by meticulously cleaning the dataset, removing stopwords, and eliminating noise, resulting in improved accuracy and reliability of sentiment analysis.
Optimized the model through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques to ensure robust performance in sentiment analysis.
Achieved a test score of approximately 87% in a sentiment analysis project by optimizing the model through the use of Trigrams in conjunction with the Logistic Regression algorithm, thereby providing valuable support for decision-making.
